            <h1>Initial Request</h1>
            <p>In an effort to provide meals to our users, we would like to provide the ability to offer peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The users should be able to
            select a sandwich, and pick it up at the kitchen in the cafeteria when it is ready.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Design Documentation</h1>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This functionality will allow users to select a meal and automatically send it to the kitchen where it will be prepared and waiting. 
                Users will be able to select the types of foods they would like, while specified admin users will be able to set up the options that are available for a given day or a given meal. The
                current set up will allow users to choose a single meal type - a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich - with several options, but this system is being designed in order to allow for additional 
                offerings in the future.</p>

            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>Users of the system will be able to order a meal. Currently there is one meal option available - Peanut Butter and Jelly (PBJ) sandwich. There are various customizations
            available for the sandwich, which can be toggled as needed by the pre-set system adminstrators. The system is designed so that in the future, additional menu items and customizations
            can be added.</p>
            <h3>Adminstration</h3>
            <p>A system adminstrator will be able to set up customizations for a given meal. The list of any available items will be available on the new Admin screen, and each item can be 
                selected. A new section will appear that will include customizations that have been set up for that particular food item, and each customization can be toggled on or off depending
                on availability of the selection. For some customizations, individual items can be toggled or changed.</p>

            <h3>Technical Functionality</h3>
            <h4>Connection Information</h4>
            <p>The system will send the information into the kitchen via the higgledy-piggledy API server. A request will be sent, and when the server receives the response
                and successfully sends it to the server in the kitchen, a response will be generated and sent back with one of a list of response codes. Once the kitchen receives the request, that server
                will translate the request and print it out so it can be created by others and served up waiting.</p>
            <h4>Request & Response</h4>
            <p>The request will be formatted as a JSON string with the information input from the user as the data points.</p>
            <p>

                }
            </p>
            <p>The response will be formatted as a JSON string, and will send back a request based on a key of response codes</p>
            <p>
